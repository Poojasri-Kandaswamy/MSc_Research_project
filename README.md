# MSc Research Project

This repository contains the code and data used for my research project. The project focuses on how hypoxia - induced genes alter the gene expression. The project includes data analysis scripts and R code to process RNAseq data, generate volcano plots, and perform other statistical analysis.

## Overview
The primary goal of this study is to identify hypoxia-induced genes in various cell types, analyze pathway enrichment of these genes, and compare gene expression profiles across various cell backgrounds under hypoxia. The repository contains R scripts and datasets that were used to conduct the analysis and visualize the results.

## Files
The following R scripts can be run for the analysis.
1. package and dataset for RNAseq.R : This script contains all the packages to be installed that would help for the analysis purpose and get ensembl dataset for the gene information.
2. data_analysis_S1.R : This script loads and preprocesses the data.
3. volcano_plot.R : This script generates a volcano plot based on the results of the differential expression analysis.
4. up_down gene.R : This script runs overrepresented gene analysis on upregulated and downregulated genes.
